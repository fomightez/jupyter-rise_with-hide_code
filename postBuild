# Try to fix the install based on https://github.com/kirbs-/hide_code/issues/29#issuecomment-274800019
# Note that I used that even though different because old code listed at that link gave error saying
# no install attriibute & only thing with install I saw when I ran `!python -c "import hide_code.hide_code as hc;print(dir(hc));"`
python -c "import hide_code.hide_code as hc;hc.install_bootstrapped_files()" 



# Implement install fix described at https://stackoverflow.com/a/39169844/8508004 to get hide_code
# showing in under `View` > `cell toolbar` menu and across toolbar proper.
# To make general, going to try avoiding hardcoding in the Python version since hoping
# to down the road combine with jupyter-rise and that install produces Python 3.6 at the moment.
